Course: Javascript and jQuery

Link: http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery

Description: Javascript is taking over the world right now -- web applications are becoming more and more front-weighted. While it used to be mostly a tool for animating drop down menus and validating form inputs, Javascript (with help from jQuery's magic) has grown into a way to produce full featured front end applications including single-page web apps.
